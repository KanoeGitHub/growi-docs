# Delete page

As the page creation progresses, you also want to delete the page.

Delete unnecessary pages and clean up the wiki.

## Delete one page

Go to the target page you want to delete
and select the delete menu shown in the image below.

![delete1](./images/delete1.png)

In the delete menu, you will see

- Delete child pages recursively.

- Delete Completely

and each of them has a check box and the first one is checked by default.

![delete2](./images/delete2.png)

Let's press the "Delete" button on the page that has no child pages.
It will delete the page and the page will be moved into trash.

Now,
you see the page with the trash can mark at the top of the hierarchy with the message.

`This page is in the trash.`

![delete3](./images/delete3.png)

After deletion, the page can no longer be referenced from the previous hierarchy.

## Check deleted pages in Trash

Click the "Deleted pages"
in the menu that appears by clicking the user name in the header.

![delete5](./images/delete5.png)

And you will see the list of deleted pages under "/trash" as shown in the image below.

![delete6](./images/delete6.png)

Clicking on a deleted page in the list will open the deleted page
with a "Put Back" button and "Delete Completely" button.

![delete3](./images/delete3.png)

Deleted pages cannot be edited.
Click "Put Back" first if you want to edit.

## Delete completely

You can permanently delete the page by clicking "Delete completely" under "/trash".

![delete3](./images/delete3.png)

Or if you delete a page with "Delete completely" checked,
the page will be permanently deleted as well.

## Delete child pages recursively

All child pages under a certain page can be deleted at once.

Let's check the page list before deleting.

![delete8](./images/delete8.png)

Select the "/tutorial" page first,
then delete it with "Delete child pages recursively" checked.

![delete9](./images/delete9.png)

![delete10](./images/delete10.png)

Then all child pages under the "/tutorial" page will be deleted.

"Page is not found" will be displayed, if you try to browse the "/tutorial" page,
after deleting completely.

![delete11](./images/delete11.png)

As you can see from the list of pages in the top page,
if you delete the "/tutorial" page,
the pages under the "/tutorial" page will also be deleted.

![delete12](./images/delete12.png)

Make use of the delete function to further develop GROWI.
