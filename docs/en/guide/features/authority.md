  `When users need to login to see pages`

  Even if the page is public,
  you will not be able to view or edit it unless you log in.
  Also, when you access the page, you will be redirected to the login page.
  However, anyone who logged in can view and edit.

### Anyone with the link

  Pages with this setting do not display to the page list or page search results.

  Only users who know the URL of the page are able to view and edit it.


  when you don't know where the page is,
  follow "Recently Created" on the home screen.

  If it's the page you created, it will be displayed to this page list.

### Just me

  Pages with this setting will not be viewed or edited by anyone except you.

  Whether it's displayed or not for users who don't belong to the group,
  You can set authority by choosing ON or Off button.

  As the default, the page you created appears in the page list and page search results.

### Only inside the group

  Pages with this setting can only be viewed and edited by users
  belonging to the group.

  Whether it's displayed or not for users who don't belong to the group,
  You can set authority by choosing ON or Off button.

  As the default, the page you created appears in the page list and page search results.
