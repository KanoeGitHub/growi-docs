# Using Tags

In GROWI, pages are generally managed using a hierarchical structure called page paths, but it is also possible to manage pages with cross-cutting attributes by attaching tags to them.

Tags make it easier to search for specific pages.

This section explains how to use tags.

## Tagging a page

Navigate to the page where the tags are going to be added.  
As shown in the image below, there is an "Add tags for this page +" button on the upper left side of the page.

Click the "Add tags for this page +" button to add tags to the page.  
When clicked, a window for editing tags will appear as shown in the image below.

This is the state in which tags are ready to be set. Japanese tags could also be added.  
Multiple tags can be added at the same time and can be deleted or edited by clicking the X button on each tag.

## Searching by tag

The search box in the Navbar can also be used to search for tags.  
Focusing on the search box will display a guide when searching, as shown in the image below.
