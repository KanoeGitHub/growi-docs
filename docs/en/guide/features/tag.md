# Using Tags

In GROWI, pages are generally managed using a hierarchical structure called page paths, but it is also possible to manage pages with cross-cutting attributes by attaching tags to them.

Tags make it easier to search for specific pages.

Here is an explanation of how to use tags.

## Tagging a page

Go to the page where you want to add a tag.  
As you can see in the image below, there is a "Add Tag +" link on the upper left side of the page.

You can add a tag by clicking on the "Add a tag +" link on the page.  
When you click on the link, a window for editing tags will appear as shown in the image below.

In this input field, type the word you want to use as a tag, then click on the red circle in the image below or press Enter.

The word will then be colored, as shown in the image below.

This is the state that can be set as a tag. Japanese tags are also available.  
You can add multiple tags at the same time, and you can delete or edit tags by clicking the X button on each tag.

You can also delete and edit tags by clicking the X button on each tag. [](. /images/tag5.png)

Once you have set up the tags you want to add to the page, click the Done button as shown in the image below.

When you click the Done button, the page will be tagged and the link will be updated to say "Edit Tags +".  
The tags on the page will be searched when clicked.

As a result of clicking on a tag attached to a page, a page search will be performed on the tag.  
The search results will show the pages with the same tag.

## Search by tag

The search box in the header menu of GROWI also allows you to search for tags.  
Hovering over the search box will display help for searching, as shown in the image below.

As a usage of `tag search', you can search for tags by using input format such as `tag:Japanese`.

Pages with the tags you have just set will be displayed in the search results.
