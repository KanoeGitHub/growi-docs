# Creating checkboxes

In GROWI, you can create checkboxes using Markdown.

```markdown
# TODO confirmation
- TODO
    - [x] Delivery
    - [ ] Inspection
    - [ ] Invoice creation
```

When the above Markdown code is written into a GROWI wiki page, it will create checkboxes as shown in the image below.
