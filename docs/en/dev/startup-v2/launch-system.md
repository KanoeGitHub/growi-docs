Perform the following steps in a terminal inside your GROWI-Dev devcontainer.

``` bash
npx lerna bootstrap
```

::: danger

### Migration

``` bash
cd packages/app
yarn migrate
```

### Launch Front-end and Back-end Server

In 2 separate terminals, run the front end client and back end server.  
Either process can be terminated with `Ctrl-C`.

### Server for developing frontend

1. `cd packages/app`
1. Use `yarn dev:client` to:
   - Build client assets and launch webpack-dev-server.
   - Detect changes in client-side files and auto-rebuild the client assets.

### Server for developing backend

1. `cd packages/app`
1. Use `yarn dev:server` to:
   - Launch the Express server.
   - Detect changes in server-side files and auto-restart the Express server.


## Additional Launches

Each time the application is launched, repeat the steps under [First Time](#first-time).

Section [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies) can be executed with yarn if the lerna package is installed in node_modules.

``` bash
yarn lerna bootstrap
```

## Production Build and Execution

Execute the following steps from the [First Time](#first-time) section.

1. Install dependencies
