# Upgrading GROWI to v5.1.x

Two major features have been implemented in v5.1.

- [Audit Log](/en/admin-guide/management-cookbook/audit-log.html)
- [API rate limits can be set by the administrator](/en/admin-guide/admin-cookbook/custom-rate-limit.md)

For the audit log, please refer to [Audit Log Setup](/en/admin-guide/admin-cookbook/audit-log-setup.html) if you wish to use the audit log, which is enabled by setting an environment variable.
