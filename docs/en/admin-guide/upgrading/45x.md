# Upgrading GROWI to v4.5.x

In v4.5, the data structure of some REST API responses has changed.
If you have your own operation such as using automation API, you need to take action.



## REST API Response Data Structure Changes

::: tip
If you are not using automation REST API, you don't need to take any action.
:::

The target is an API whose endpoint URL started with `/_api/v3`.

### `/_api/v3/bookmarks/info` response example

### Before

```json
{
    "data": {
        "sumOfBookmarks": 0,
        "isBookmarked": false
    }
}
```

#### After

```json
{
    "sumOfBookmarks": 0,
    "isBookmarked": false
}
```



## Check before Upgrading

- [x] Are you operate it using the GROWI API (endpoint starting with `/_api/v3`)?
