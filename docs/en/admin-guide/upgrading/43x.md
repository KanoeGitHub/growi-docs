# Upgrading GROWI to v4.3.x

There's nothing to do with upgrading from v4.2 to v4.3.

## New Slack Integration

A new method of slack integration has been added.

By installing the Official GROWI Bot or Custom GROWI Bot you preare to your workspace, you can use GROWI functions by the `/growi` command from slack workspace.

::: tip
conventional methods can still be used.
